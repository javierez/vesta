## FEATURE:

 Let's redefine template controls: in @playground                                                                                          │

│   8. Other information rather than beds, baths and sqmtrs (select max two out of all the fields or columns from the properties   │
│   or listings table)\                                                                                                            │
│   9. short description (y/n) 
10. listingType (Alquiler/venta/you already know as well)


so I want you to have all these possibilities. Maybe it is necessary to have more than one template because, for example, the number of images can disrupt a lot the cartel. I don't know what you think. But the thing is I want to be ready to cover all aspects shown in the list.

In teh future, some preferences will be stored in the accounts table and the infromation for the property will come from our database. But for now we're playing with the playground
