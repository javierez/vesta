## FEATURE:
We have created already a cartelería section in /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/(dashboard)/account-admin/carteleria/page.tsx, which has a component in /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/components/admin/carteleria-templates.tsx

Let's redesign the whole page.

In this page, what will happen is the following. We have like a lot of templates for different formats: a4, a3, a2, vertical, horizontal, for piso, local, casa, garaje, solar. So this page will be like a selection of their favorite templates and styles so that customers can choose their favorite carteles. Can you do a modern but still minimalistic menu to choose for all the options that we could have?

I don't know, maybe it makes sense that we have like MAIN styles (you choose one style for the whole cartelería) and then you can go further and edit each type of cartel and more tailored to your needs (we will have even more plantillas depending on the fields they wanna add. Ex: in the garage, I don't want to add a mini description -- have a sleection just for that -- maybe it is too much, idk).
