## FEATURES:
Create a landing page, basic, for the real estate CRM that I'm building. All in spanish. Make it basic and this will be the main page in the /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/page.tsx

and what we will do with the current content of /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/page.tsx is move it to /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx if possible. 


Make sure we don't change the current functionality. The landing will allow us to identify (login) although no auth is built yet. Also, do it commercial and explain the functionalities of the page and also the expirational features (like the ones of twilio and the ones on the @read.md file)

## EXAMPLES:
No examples provided.  

## DOCUMENT
It's just UI

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
Make sure all the links of the other pages that before were referencing  /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/page.tsx now references Downloads/vesta/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
