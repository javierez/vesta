## FEATURE:

[Insert your feature here]

## EXAMPLES:

[Provide and explain examples that you have in the `public/examples/` folder]

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List out any documentation (web pages, sources for an MCP server like Crawl4AI RAG, etc.) that will need to be referenced during development]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Any other considerations or specific requirements - great place to include gotchas that you see AI coding assistants miss with your projects a lot]



## FEATURE:

- Pydantic AI agent that has another Pydantic AI agent as a tool.
- Research Agent for the primary agent and then an email draft Agent for the subagent.
- CLI to interact with the agent.
- Gmail for the email draft agent, Brave API for the research agent.

## EXAMPLES:

In the `examples/` folder, there is a README for you to read to understand what the example is all about and also how to structure your own README when you create documentation for the above feature.

- `examples/cli.py` - use this as a template to create the CLI
- `examples/agent/` - read through all of the files here to understand best practices for creating Pydantic AI agents that support different providers and LLMs, handling agent dependencies, and adding tools to the agent.

Don't copy any of these examples directly, it is for a different project entirely. But use this as inspiration and for best practices.

## DOCUMENTATION:

Pydantic AI documentation: https://ai.pydantic.dev/

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- Include a .env.example, README with instructions for setup including how to configure Gmail and Brave.
- Include the project structure in the README.
- Virtual environment has already been set up with the necessary dependencies.
- Use python_dotenv and load_env() for environment variables
