## FEATURE:

Comprehensive validation and standardization of the multi-step property creation form system. Following our successful standardization of the property characteristics forms, we need to analyze and validate the property creation workflow components to ensure consistency, proper field coverage, and alignment with the established property characteristics forms.

## EXAMPLES:

### Multi-Step Form Wrapper
- `@src/components/crear/property-form.tsx` - Main wrapper component that orchestrates the 11-step property creation process with progress tracking, navigation logic, and centralized data management

### Step-by-Step Form Pages  
Located in `@src/components/crear/pages/`:

**Core Property Information Pages:**
- `first.tsx` - Basic Information (price, listing type, property type, contacts, agent)
- `second.tsx` - Property Details (bedrooms, bathrooms, surface area, year built, conservation)
- `third.tsx` - Address & Location (street, postal code, city, province, municipality)

**Features & Characteristics Pages:**
- `fourth.tsx` - Equipment & Services (elevator, garage, storage, heating, AC, appliances)
- `fifth.tsx` - Orientation & Exposure (exterior/interior, brightness, compass orientation)
- `sixth.tsx` - Additional Characteristics (security, building features, kitchen details)
- `seventh.tsx` - Luxury & Comfort (views, wellness features, outdoor spaces, smart home)
- `eighth.tsx` - Complementary Spaces (additional rooms, utility areas)
- `nineth.tsx` - Materials & Finishes (flooring, materials, construction details)

**Content & Rental Pages:**
- `description.tsx` - Property Description (AI-generated and manual descriptions)
- `rent.tsx` - Rental Properties (rental-specific fields, terms, conditions)

### Supporting Components
- `form-skeleton.tsx` - Loading state component
- `contact-popup.tsx` - Contact management modal
- `elements/room_selector.tsx` - Room quantity selector
- `elements/year_slider.tsx` - Year selection slider

## DOCUMENTATION:

### Current Analysis Required:

**Field Coverage Validation:**
- Compare creation form fields with property characteristics forms to identify gaps
- Ensure all fields in `property-characteristics-form.tsx` have corresponding creation form inputs
- Validate that property-type specific adaptations are consistent between both systems

**Data Flow Consistency:**
- Verify that field names, types, and validation rules match between creation and characteristics forms
- Check that the `globalFormData` structure supports all necessary property data
- Ensure save operations use the same database fields and API endpoints

**UI/UX Standardization:**
- Confirm consistent component usage (Input, Select, Checkbox, Button patterns)
- Validate layout consistency (card-based design, spacing, typography)
- Check for proper error handling and save state management

**Property Type Adaptations:**
- Verify that property-specific field hiding/showing logic matches between systems
- Ensure solar, garage, and local property types have appropriate creation form steps
- Validate that skipped steps in creation form align with specialized characteristics forms

### Step Navigation Logic:
The form implements step skipping based on property type:
- **Solar properties**: Skip steps 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 (equipment, orientation, additional, spaces, materials)
- **Garage properties**: Skip steps 5, 7, 8, 9 (orientation, luxury, spaces, materials)
- **Standard properties**: Include all 11 steps

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

### Critical Validation Points:

**Data Consistency:**
- Field names must match exactly between creation and characteristics forms
- Default values should be consistent across both systems
- Property type subtypes must use the same Spanish translations we recently implemented
- Database save operations should target identical schema fields

**Form State Management:**
- Both systems should use compatible save state indicators (idle/modified/saving/saved/error)
- Error handling patterns should be standardized
- Progress tracking and form position logic should align with characteristics form expectations

**User Experience:**
- Navigation between creation and characteristics forms should be seamless
- Field pre-population from creation to characteristics should work flawlessly
- Property type changes should trigger consistent field visibility updates in both systems

**Technical Implementation:**
- TypeScript interfaces should be shared or strictly compatible between systems
- API endpoints and data transformation logic should be consistent
- Component props and callback patterns should follow the same conventions

### Validation Methodology:

1. **Field Mapping Analysis**: Create comprehensive mapping between creation form fields and characteristics form fields
2. **Property Type Logic Review**: Verify step skipping logic matches characteristics form field visibility
3. **Data Flow Testing**: Trace data from creation through to characteristics forms
4. **UI Component Audit**: Ensure consistent component usage and styling patterns
5. **Integration Testing**: Validate seamless transition between creation and editing workflows

### Expected Outcomes:

- **Complete Field Coverage**: Every field in characteristics forms has corresponding creation form input
- **Consistent Property Types**: Solar, garage, and local properties behave identically in both systems  
- **Unified Data Model**: Same field names, types, validation rules, and save operations
- **Seamless User Flow**: Users can create properties and immediately edit characteristics without data loss or inconsistencies
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Shared components, interfaces, and patterns reduce duplication and improve maintainability
