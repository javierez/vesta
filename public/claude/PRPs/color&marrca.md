## FEATURES:
Inside marca and logo, in @src/components/admin/account-branding.tsx                                                        
- do not use any background in the component in general (mean it like transparent background talking about UI)                                                                 
- use a placeholder to upload logo similar to other placeholders in the codebase                                      
- store the logo in inmobiliariaacripolis folder in AWS
- apply a remove background functionality (first search online libraries pnpm to remove background of images) and store two versions of the image: with and without background. The image will be stored once we upload it.
- also look for other library to extract a palette from the image (pnpm) and bellow, develop a component that will show the recommended palette for branding of 6 colors.
