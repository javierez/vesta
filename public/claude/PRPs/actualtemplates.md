## FEATURE:
We have created already a cartelería section in /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/(dashboard)/account-admin/carteleria/page.tsx

Let's create the actual templates that will render in the section named 'Estilo'. Take each of the placeholders for each of the styles and we will have to design a cartel. Which will have 3 images, and then it will have a price, number of beds, number of baths and sqmtrs, title (piso en venta), location (Barrio + '(León)''), and then a qr code. Remember we're designign mockups. Make a button in each of the placeholders to allow me to go fullscreen and see in detail each of the placeholders. The images to use in all of the mockups are the same. and are storeed in AWS in the folder inmobiliaria acropolis (already used in the code) witht eh following names:
- vesta-configuration-files/templates/IMG_0744.JPG
- vesta-configuration-files/templates/IMG_0745.JPG
- vesta-configuration-files/templates/IMG_0749.JPG

Use for the mockups mostly neutral colors, as we will adapt the palette of colors later.





## EXAMPLES:
No exaples provided, first time doing it. We have some AWS connections to the same vesta-configuration-files in the codebase. You cantake that example.

Examples for templates I can include in the images folder :/Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/public/claude/images


## DOCUMENTATION:
Use best practices in design

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
Please just focus on templates and fullscreen mode, but rest leave it as it is.
