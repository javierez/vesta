 would you be able to add the calendar events to @src/app/(dashboard)/calendario/ 's components? Like depending on the start and end    │
│   date they would fit into the calendar's grid. \                                                                                        │
│   \                                                                                                                                      │
│   Also make it start  from 00 and to 23:59 next day but by default it will show from 9am, as the normal calendars. But I see that it     │
│   ends at 20:00 which is not ok\                                                                                                         │
│   \                                                                                                                                      │
│   Also add a component similar to the one for create                                                                                     │
│   contacts'/Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/components/contactos/crear/contact-form.tsx' but this time will work for         │
│   calendars and will be accessed from both :crear evento in @src/app/(dashboard)/calendario/ and in @src/app/(dashboard)/operaciones/    │
│   which is another quick link in @src/components/dashboard/OperacionesQuickActionsCard.tsx \                                             │
│   \                                                                                                                                      │
│   Also, when I click in any part of the calendar which is not filled by an event, it will open the create event component we're talking  │
│   about using the clicked date and time. This menu will have a X which will close the window and return to previous page.\               │
│   \                                                                                                                                      │
