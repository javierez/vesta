## FEATURES:
In the landing page, current landing page, in the NavBar do some changes.
Comprar-Vender and all of that should be deprecated because that's like for a Real Estate business, not a CRM, so change it using something that I could use commercially. Look at other CRMs of the market (not RE) or SaaS tools best practices.

Also, in the top right, we should add the elements to sign in and sign up that will redirect to the current UI elements that we have: /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/auth/signin and /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/auth/signup. 

Moreover; do not let me access dashboard or any functionality, not even the UI if I haven't authenticated: /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/middleware.ts
