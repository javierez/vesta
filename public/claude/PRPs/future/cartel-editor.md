## FEATURES:
So the cartel manager what he will do is basically We'll allow you to select from all the pictures that we have for that property. So basically in the schema we have the property images table and we have for example in image-studio-gallery An image gallery which is very small so we could use something like that to select the images. Maybe doing them a little bit longer, wider or bigger. I don't mind. And then basically from the pictures you will be given a set of like a side menu With different options, this is the same side menu that we have at http://localhost:3000/account-admin/carteleria (opciones de visualization)
