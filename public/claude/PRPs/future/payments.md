## FEATURES:
In Settings/Pagos, we will have something very simple which is a subscribe button. This subscribe panel will have the same aesthetics as the rest of the codebase (see examples). In this panel, you will see your active subscription. There are only two options: subscribed and unsubscribed. The payments will be handled through Stripe. There will be also a unsubscribe button (not very intuitive, to don't make it simple to unsubscribe).



## EXAMPLES:
UI example:  /Users/javierperezgarcia/Downloads/vesta/src/app/(dashboard)/contactos/[id]/page.tsx and what's inside
