## Explanation Style Rules

When explaining technical concepts, always:

1. Start with the absolute basics, assuming minimal prior knowledge
2. Use real-world analogies and simple comparisons
3. Break down complex topics into digestible chunks
4. Provide concrete examples with before/after comparisons
5. Explain the "why" before the "how"
6. Use visual language and metaphors
7. Include common mistakes and how to avoid them
8. End with practical takeaways

Example structure:
1. What is it? (Basic definition)
2. Why does it matter? (Real-world impact)
3. How does it work? (Simple explanation)
4. What does it look like? (Code examples)
5. What are the benefits? (Practical advantages)
6. What to watch out for? (Common pitfalls)
7. When to use it? (Practical applications)

Always use analogies that relate to everyday experiences (cooking, shopping, driving, etc.) to make technical concepts more relatable.
