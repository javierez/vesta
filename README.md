# TODOs: 

## High Priority
- Pasarela de pagos
- Watermark
- Carteler√≠a
- Upscaller images
- Operations page
- Calendar integration



## Med Priority
- Generaci√≥n de Nota de encargo: P000460

## Low Priority
- Rent: add deposit information
- Separators (tabs on top) in Property and Contact detail pages -> improve UI 
- Short name for barrios


## To Validate
- Properties: Reading the formulario nueva creaci√≥n
- Reading Ficha de Venta: try out other formularios
- Authentication: check if we really have separation of data per request and user.
- Make sure forms are 'similar' to the casa/piso one (!)






## To improve
- Progress bar when uploading logo -- also changing the tooltip of best recommendations to before when image was uploaded
- Add multimedia material in Fotocasa integration (videos, tours)
- Add multichannel publishing (spanishhouses, kyero, pisos.com, think spain, listglobally basic)



     



    




### Operations Page?
With and without tasks to do. Each of it with its process and its documents
- Prospect: ---
- Lead: ----
- Deal: -------


### Rent: Rent Assistant (xxx)

### Portal: Integraci√≥n Idealista (not urgent)

### Properties: Converesational agent






Changes 



FIXES
- Cliked state in Finalizar -- change the clicked state.
- Armarios empotrados -- apparently fixed (to be checked)
- C√≥digo de invitaci√≥n (non-mock) -- apparently fixed (to be checked)
- Change design of 'Redirigiendo al dashboard' -- change cliked state


- Redirecting me to pages if I want to go quick: from first to second, to third, and so on. (changed but to be tested)
- What happens if I upload Referencia Catastral but also a Ficha de Venta
- After I click on @property-identification-form on siguiente (once is ready). It has like a clicked state where it says cargando or something like that. But between that and before the property-form is reached, there is some time where I don't have anything and I would be able to click on finish again.
- Authentication with Google 
- Authentication in general
- 
- Reduce barrios lenght (admin task)
-

OPTIMIZATIONS
- Concurrent data fethcing: contacts, listings, etc.
- Query Optimization: reduced queries
- Middleware caching: 2 minute cache for auth session validation
- Data Caching: when needed
